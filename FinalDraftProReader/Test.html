          <div class='Dialogue'>We had better finish soon. Don’t you have a call to make?</div>
          <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>Oh yeah.</div>
          <div class='Character'>KATRINA</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>And I have that party to go to.</div>
          <div class='Character'>MELISSA</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>And we have date night. Don’t forget that. Now what are we going to do with these huge piles?</div>
          <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>Okay. This is easy. Aside from the buckets, there are 8, and only 8, flavors you have to choose from for each item in a bucket.</div>
          <div class='Character'>KATRINA</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>So it’s not just 4 buckets. Now we have to memorize 8 tags.</div>
          <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>Even easier than that. There are 3 types of flavors. Each type has only 2 values. 2 times 2 times 2 equals 8, see?</div>
          <div class='Character'>KATRINA</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>I’m not following.</div>
          <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>First one let’s call “Genre”. It’s the most important one of all, even more than the buckets. The two values are “Business” and “System”</div>
          <div class='Character'>KATRINA</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>What does that mean?</div>
          <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>Is this about business stuff and not related to tech? Or about tech stuff and not related to business?</div>
          <div class='Character'>KATRINA</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>Okay. Makes no sense to me, but okay.</div>
          <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>So first you pick one of those two: Business or System.</div>
          <div class='Character'>MELISSA</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>And then?</div>
          <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>Usually I put Business or System and then the bucket name.</div>
          <div class='Character'>MELISSA</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>I mean then -- what are the next tags?</div>
          <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>After genre and bucket, second flavor we’ll call Abstraction Level. Values can be “Abstract”, and “Realized”</div>
          <div class='Character'>MELISSA</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>So it’s genre, bucket name, and abstraction level. What’s the last one?</div>
          <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>Third flavor type is the Temporal Indicator, whether we’re talking about right now or in the future. It can be “As-is” or “To-be”</div>
          <div class='Character'>KATRINA</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>You’re going to need to say that again.</div>
          <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>Okay, but there’s one twist. The flavors don’t all go together. It’s genre, bucket, abstract, time.</div>
          <div class='Character'>KATRINA</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>You’re going to need to say that again.</div>
          <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>Look it’s easy. Pick 1 of 2 genres, 1 of 4 buckets, 1 of 2 abstraction levels, and then 1 of 2 temporal indicators. You’re done.</div>
          <div class='Character'>KATRINA</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>Easy.</div>

          <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>That’s what I’m afraid of. How about we learn the tags, use them in our projects, and then talk about systems?</div>

          <div class='Dialogue'>We learn by engagement with the enemy!</div>
          <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>That’s exactly right, and we’re going to talk about that a lot more as the series goes on.</div>
          <div class='Character'>BUSINESS DANIEL</div>
          <div class='Dialogue'>The Business tag is the most important.</div>
