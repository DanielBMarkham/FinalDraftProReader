    <div class='Dialogue'>Our backlog? What a mess!</div>
    <div class='Character'>PERSON2</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>We’ve got a great team. We’ve got some really smart architects. Why aren’t they working more closely together?</div>
    <div class='Character'>PERSON3</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>My team’s in two locations! We use a great tool, but we’re still having difficultly staying on the same page.</div>
    <div class='Character'>PERSON4</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>Sure, we have a backlog -- but we never really use it. It’s for managers.</div>
    <div class='Character'>PERSON5</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>We’ve got over 500 items on our bug tracker. Nobody even wants to look at it.</div>
    <div class='Character'>PERSON6</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>We spent three hours last week arguing about estimation. How are we supposed to plan effectively and deliver projects on a schedule?</div>
    <div class='Character'>PERSON7</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>Our stories don’t look right. My team is doing Data Warehousing and B-I stuff. We’re not creating software. How are we supposed to write our User Stories?</div>
    <div class='Character'>PERSON8</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>We hate our meetings. Everything we do with the backlog takes too long. We never seem to get done.</div>
    <div class='Character'>PERSON9</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>We’ve been doing this a year and we still don’t create User Stories that set the developers up for success.</div>
    <div class='Character'>PERSON10</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>My organization is big. Really big! Our backlog items are so dependent on other teams that we can’t deliver reliably.</div>
    <div class='Character'>PERSON11</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>I know what the Product Owner does with a team, but how does he make decisions? How does he work with the business?</div>
    <div class='Character'>PERSON12</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>We keep saying that we’re “done” with something, but then we keep working on it anyway. Nobody even believes us any more.</div>

    <div class='Dialogue'>I remember my first day as an Agile coach. I felt like the biggest imposter on the planet. I hadn’t taken a day of Agile training - no Scrum, no release planning. Nothing.</div>

    <div class='Dialogue'>For the next retro they were planning on each of them making their own haiku. Another coach walked up and they started arguing about something. It ended completely when the other guy said, “Well, you know, Mike Cohn says...”</div>

    <div class='Dialogue'>So?</div>
    <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>Francis Bacon lived in the late 1500s. When he grew up, the smart people were all ministers, clergy. Colleges existed to introduce young men to the established and wise way of the ancients.</div>
    <div class='Character'>KATRINA</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>Ummm.</div>
    <a href='#Scene:19'></a>
    <div class='SceneTitle'>INT. GREENSCREEN - CONTINUOUS</div>
    <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>You became smart by learning the established and perfect way of the ancients, which reflected the perfect way God created the universe. Then you took that perfection and were supposed to use it in thinking about the world.</div>
    <div class='Character'>KATRINA</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>Was he on a Scrum team?</div>
    <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
    <div class='Parenthetical'>(The you-are-a-smartass-smirk)</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>Ministers would focus on style, presentation, on influencing how people felt about their life through sharing, trust, and social games -- er, I mean religious ceremonies. Debates would happen about tiny and obscure things. People would appeal to authority as a way to shut down discussion. You were intelligent if you took the pure ideas of the ancients and decomposed them, almost like geometry, into small pieces that folks could debate.</div>

    <div class='Dialogue'>Sounds like a pretty sucky time to be alive, huh.</div>
    <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>It was. For hundreds of years colleges trained people, but mankind was still in the basic place it was hundreds of years ago. That’s why we call it the Dark Ages. Nothing was getting done. It was stagnant.</div>
    <div class='Character'>KATRINA</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>Good thing all those old guys are dead now, isn’t it?</div>

    <div class='SceneTitle'>INT. GREENSCREEN - CONTINUOUS</div>
    <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>The coaching team I met, along with many other Agile practitioners? They’re focused on style, presentation, on influencing how people feel through sharing, trust, and social games. Debates happen about tiny and obscure things. People appeal to authority as a way to shut down discussion. You were a senior Agile practitioner if you took the pure ideas of the experts and decomposed them using deductive logic into small pieces that you could then debate.</div>
    <div class='Character'>KATRINA</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>Uh-oh.</div>
    <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>Nothing was getting done. I didn’t have an education. I was a coach because of my skill at delivering complex technical project on time using Agile practices. Didn’t much care about famous people or their famous ideas. All I care about is getting things done.</div>

    <div class='SceneTitle'>INT. GREENSCREEN - CONTINUOUS</div>

    <div class='Dialogue'>And the others weren’t like that. Dad doesn’t fit in. There’s a news flash.</div>
    <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>Lots of activity was taking place around the backlog. But much of what they thought of as value didn’t match up with what I thought of as value. The way they thought of solving problems wasn’t the way I thought of solving problems. I looked at backlogs from an engineering background, while they saw them from a social background.</div>
    <div class='Character'>KATRINA</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>Was Bacon an engineer?</div>
    <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>No, but he started wondering why they were doing the same things they had for hundreds of years. Why there wasn’t any progress.</div>
    <div class='Character'>KATRINA</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>Like you did.</div>
    <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>Yes. Bacon’s problem is exactly the same as mine: the system he found himself in had existed for a long time and a lot of people were invested in lots of different great ideas handed down from leaders in the field. But the ideas all didn’t mesh with each another, and nobody knew how to move forward. Not much progress was made. Nothing was improving.</div>

    <div class='Character'>KATRINA</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>So? Just write down a big list.</div>
    <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>Like that’s going to help us with an outline. Then there’s the problem that most backlog instruction, let’s face it, sucks.</div>
    <div class='Character'>KATRINA</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>So. Part of your outline will be explaining how existing instruction doesn’t work, right?</div>
    <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>Yeah, sure. Then we gotta be realistic. There’s stuff we can help them with, then there’s stuff they have to do on their own.</div>

    <div class='Dialogue'>I ran an informal survey last year of teams and backlogs. Know what I found? It’s not just that training is for new projects instead of mature projects. There’s a ton of small projects getting trained as if they’re big projects. And huge projects trying to act like 3-person teams.</div>

    <div class='Dialogue'>Organizations and teams get caught up in the same situation. They exist because of wanting to help others. Initially they’re doing great and kicking butt, but over time that fades. And instead of being a small group with a clear mission, they become a diffuse group not as focused as before.</div>

    <div class='Dialogue'>In the “New Orgonon”, Bacon makes four arguments. Knowledge, skill, and training in themselves have no value. It has to be used. Backlogs are the tool we use to describe and convert our capability into something that meets our values.</div>

    <div class='Dialogue'>We have to separate religion and science. In our work we need to separate how new fads and trends make us feel about things from empirical data.

    <div class='Dialogue'>Natural philosophy, unlike religion, works through induction. Through observation we come up with rules that hold for new observations of the same kind. If it works for 1, 2, 3, and 4, it’s likely to work for 5, 6, 7 and so on.</div>

    <div class='Dialogue'>In a religious discussion, we work through deduction, which is a completely different way of thinking. We already know what is true, we just try to deduce how it accounts for whatever we’re seeing. Big pieces to little pieces. People tell us what to do. We don’t ask questions.</div>

    <div class='Dialogue'>In the old way of teaching backlogs, we give students what the result looks like. Their job is to learn how to mechanically break big things into little things. There is a presumption of authority.</div>

    <div class='SceneTitle'>INT. GREENSCREEN - CONTINUOUS</div>
    <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>Bacon pointed out that no one mind or committee knows everything and has all the answers. Science is dynamic, cooperative, open, and cumulative. Because nobody knows everything, science forces us always to work with each other, change things up, build on what others have done. Method is absolutely crucial. Method puts us on the right path. Genius is like being a good runner. Being a good runner on the wrong path is just going to take you in the wrong direction faster.</div>

    <div class='Dialogue'>Same goes for us. No one mind or committee knows what the backlog should be either. Method is absolutely crucial. Being able to work backlogs puts us on the right path.

    <div class='Dialogue'>Then he hit the reader in the gut again. Guess what? He said, you don’t have to be smart! Even a dullard poking along by himself, with the right method, can do important things. There are a lot of startups helping a lot of people where the founders aren’t the sharpest knives in the drawer. In fact, some V-Cs in the startup community view intelligence as counter-indicative of the ability of a startup to do something useful.</div>

    <div class='Dialogue'>So why are we so hesitant to learn patiently from nature? Why did man have to set up authorities and structures and then try to make what they did conform to those? In our world, why do we continually let our focus drift from our values? Why do we continue to create top-down control systems and then force everything we do to conform to them, instead of continuing to build and refactor from the bottom-up?</div>

    <div class='Character'>DANIEL</div>
    <div class='Dialogue'>It’s a mind-bending question, and one of the reasons I like philosophy so much. Bacon was very religious. He felt the reason we kept making the same mistakes over and over again was because of pride. Man’s nature was always to create his idols and worship them, to seek and find bliss in the pure instead of struggle in the real world. In his mind, this was a terrible sin.</div>

    <div class='Dialogue'>Sir Francis Bacon was able to take his society’s own value system and show how it needed to be torn down and started over. He turned the system on itself.
